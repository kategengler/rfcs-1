# RFC Stages

## Summary

Ember's users should be able to look at an RFC and know more about how close it is to being part of a stable release. This proposal introduces explicit stages for RFCs, covering the steps from the initial draft to the shipped result. Inspired by TC39, these stages are a communication and collaboration tool. They can give the community greater visibility into Ember's development, encourage participation, and improve cross-team coordination. This RFC does not aim to substantially change the existing process, but rather apply labels to what already happens informally.

## Motivation

It can be difficult for both users and contributors of Ember to know the status of a new feature. Has it been approved? Is it a work in progress? What still needs to be done? Which version of Ember did it ship in?

We can see that stages are needed when we consider the following:

1. Community feedback that it was difficult to follow along with the progression of Ember Octane's features
2. Challenges uncovered in the existing RFC Tracking process
3. The long-standing, but stagnant goal of providing a public-facing status board
4. Confusion about what it means for an RFC to be merged. There is a common myth that a merged RFC indicates that a feature will be in the next release, when instead it is a green flag for implementation work to begin.

To understand the problem, it is helpful to think of the informal stages a merged RFC already can progress through: We have RFCs for which we have needed to indicate a change in direction ([MU](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0143-module-unification.html)), RFCs that have needed to be clarified/replaced ([Named Blocks](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0226-named-blocks.html)), RFCs waiting to be implemented, and RFCs whose features have been included in a stable release. Each of these scenarios was handled in a thoughtful manner, but they were difficult for users to follow along with.

This proposal aims to build on the success of RFC 300, [RFC (Request for Comments) Process Update]([https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0300-rfc-process-update.md](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0300-rfc-process-update.md)).

## Detailed design

### Stages:

A successful RFC can move through the following stages. Whenever an RFC moves to the next stage, there is a PR to update it.

| Stage| Description| Criteria to enter | Requires FCP to enter? |
| -----| -----------|----------------------------------| ----- |
| Proposed | A pull request made to the RFC repository which is open for evaluation. | n/a -- anybody can create an RFC PR | no |
| Exploring | An RFC deemed worth pursuing but in need of more work. | The core team believes the RFC should be pursued, but the RFC may still need some more work, discussion, and/or a champion before it can move to the next stage. | no |
| Accepted | The direction of work has been determined. An "Accepted" RFC is not necessary in-progress. | The RFC is fully specified, and it is clear who will support the implementation. If there are unanswered questions, we have outlined them and expect that they will be answered before "Ready for Release." The RFC has been in Final Comment Period, and the relevant core team has consensus to merge it, thus accepting the proposal. | yes |
| Ready for Release | The implementation of the RFC is complete. | The teams review the work to determine when it can be included in a stable release. At this stage, features or deprecations may be available for use behind a feature flag, in beta, etc. This is also the time ensure learning materials have been prepared. Today, this would be the "go/no-go" decision by a particular team. The technical implementation is complete according to plan outlined in the RFC, and is in harmony with any changes in Ember that have occurred since the RFC was first written. | yes |
| Released | The work is published. If it is codebase-related work, it is in a stable version of the relevant package(s). |  The relevant core teams coordinate to include the work in a stable release, and/or publish the materials. If there are any critical deviations from the original RFC, they are briefly noted at the top of the RFC. | no |
| Recommended | The feature/resource is recommended for general use. | If it is a codebase change, it is well documented and has clear migration paths. It is consistent with Ember's mental models. | yes |

There are two additional statuses for RFCs that will not move forward:

- **Discontinued** - a previously Accepted RFC that is either in conflict with Ember's evolving programming model or is superseded by another active RFC.
- **Closed** - Proposed RFCs that will not be moved into the next stage. // TODO: Should this require FCP?

#### Proposed

Proposed RFCs are opened as pull requests to the RFC repository. Anybody make 
create an RFC. The format should follow the templates in the RFC repository. 
There is currently a default template and a deprecation RFC template. This 
process is discussed in depth in the RFC repo README.

An RFC's number is the number of it's original proposal PR.

From "proposed" an RFC may be "FCP to close" or "FCP to Accept" or be 
moved to the "Exploring" stage.

#### Closed

A proposed RFC may be closed after an FCP period. This is the same as in the 
current process.

#### Exploring

#### Accepted

An RFC that has been "accepted" has complete prose and has sat through an 
"FCP to Accept" period. The community has weighed in and consensus has been 
achieved on the direction. The RFC has a champion within one of the relevant 
core team(s). This is equivalent to today's RFCs being merged.

#### Ready for Release

The RFC has been implemented, any relevant learning materials work has been done. 


#### Released

#### Recommended


#### Discontinued


### FCP

FCP stands for "final comment period." Multiple stages may have their own FCPs. An FCP is an opportunity for the community and core team members to weight in before an RFC moves to the next stage.

### Editing merged RFCs

A merged RFC may be edited via a Pull Request process. Edits may include things like:

- Updating the stage
- An optional note at the top that summarizes minor adjustments to the RFC design, at the time that the RFC's work became available for general use. This note can be very brief, and link out to other resources like a blog post. For example, an update might simply say "See `<blog post>` for more information about this feature." This note is not intended to be updated across time.
- Updating any part of the RFC prose, in order to keep a written record of the changes and rationale.

Today, these types of changes do happen. We just don't write them down. So, merge criteria should be very loose.

Major changes should have a new RFC. The old RFC is later marked "Discontinued" when the replacement is merged. 

### How this applies to non-code RFCs

Ember's RFC process can be used for process and work plans that are not about code. Some examples include Roadmap RFCs, this RFC itself, and changes to learning resources.

When such an RFC is a Candidate for Release, the work should be shipped as described, and the result should presented to the teams with the intent of gathering feedback about whether anything is missing. If there is agreement that the work is complete, the RFC may be marked "Released" and a date is provided instead of a version.

### Changes to RFC meta

RFC meta is the block of text at the start of an RFC that includes data about its stage, links to relevant info, etc.

Before:

    - Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
    - Relevant Team(s): (fill this in with the [team(s)](README.md#relevant-teams) to which this RFC applies)
    - RFC PR: (after opening the RFC PR, update this with a link to it and update the file name)
    - Tracking: (leave this empty)

After:

    - Stage: Proposed (later updated to other stages)
    - Release version/date: Unreleased (later updated with vX.Y.Z or YYYY-MM-DD)
    - Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
    - Relevant Team(s): (fill this in with the [team(s)](README.md#relevant-teams) to which this RFC applies)
    - RFC PR: (after opening the RFC PR, update this with a link to it and update the file name)
    - Tracking: (URLs to project boards, quest issues, etc. Separate by a comma and space.)

### Reconciling past RFCs

For codebase-related RFCs that have already been merged, the release version is only required to be added to RFCs whose implementation was released after February 1st, 2018 (near the release of Ember 3). This is to preserve the time and effort of our contributors and volunteers.

A stage will be applied to all previously merged RFCs.

### Core team sign-off for Release

The Core Teams' review of readiness for release has historically been an informal process. This RFC formalizes the responsibility by creating a stage for gathering confirmation that all necessary work is complete.

When the work described in an RFC is ready for Release, a PR to make the change to the RFC is added by the RFC champion, and each team is requested as a reviewer. A representative of each team adds a review, and the community is also invited to comment via one week of FCP (final comment period). If a team does not respond to the request, it is assumed that the release may proceed. 

Approvals for RFCs whose work is spread across multiple releases and packages are handled on a case-by-case basis. If the work for an RFC is spread across multiple releases of Ember, the RFC is considered to be in the Released stage when all features are complete.

## How we teach this

- The Stages section above will be added to the README of the RFCs repository.
- Frontmatter will be added to the template for new RFCs (see below)
- A blog post will announce the updates to the RFC process
- Past RFCs should be updated to include their stage and release version, following the description in "Reconciling past RFCs."

### Stages as communication tool

Additionally, this RFC would unlock our ability to create a status board where everyone can easily see the progress of RFC. Today, if you need to know when an RFC feature was available in a stable release, you need to comb through release blog posts. Instead, we could use the frontmatter as data that powers the app. This app is not a requirement for this RFC, but rather an example of how we could use the information provided by stages.

### Non-goals

This RFC does not intend to:

- substantially alter the functional process for RFCs
- speed up the RFC process
- change the timing of when a feature is released
- exhaustively cover all steps and processes

## Case study

Here is how we could have applied this model to Tracked Properties, which was split across two RFCs: [#410](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0410-tracked-properties.md) and [#478](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0478-tracked-properties-updates.md).

| Stage| Description| Criteria to advance to next step | Requires FCP to enter? |
| -----| -----------|----------------------------------| ----- |
| Proposed | A PR is opened to the RFCs repo for Tracked Properties | The framework team talks about the RFC in the weekly meetings, and there's general agreement to pursue the idea. | no |
| Exploring | @pzuraz keeps adding details to the RFC, explores the design space, and collaborates with others to get to the final design. | The full story has been thought out. @pzuraq expects to have the time resources to work on implementation. There were no "known unknowns" questions. | no |
| Accepted | @pzuraq works on implementation. The feature is enabled in canary under feature flag. We learn that the feature causes a behavior regression in the interop story. @pzuraq works out a new plan to accommodate interop, then opens a PR to update the RFC prose. | The core team has reviewed the updates and has consensus to merge the update PR. | yes |
| Ready for Release | Determine which version to release the feature in, and finish up final steps like docs. | Ship it! | yes |
| Released | Ember's users begin using the feature, as of v3.13. | Tracked is covered in the guides, and migration path resources are available. | no |
| Recommended | Tracked becomes recommended in version 3.15 (the initial version for Octane) | n/a | yes |

How was the actual process different from the imaginary case study above? In reality, there were two separate RFCs needed to land the feature, and there were fewer opportunities for people to follow along, give input, and understand the status.

## Drawbacks

Making updates to past RFCs can generate a lot of  GitHub notifications for people who watch the repository. We think that the benefit of knowing when an RFC is available in a stable release outweighs this drawback. Additionally, in the future, if an app displays the frontmatter data, someone could use that as their main source of information. Lastly, the Ember Times does a great job curating RFC updates, so someone could watch it instead if the RFC repo itself has too much information.

## Alternatives/State of the Art

This section covers how other projects have handled this type of tracking, and how we have done it in the past.

## Vue

[Vue's stages](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs#the-rfc-life-cycle) are concise and to the point. This is worth considering because you don't need to know the process deeply in order to understand it. The lower number of stages equates to less overhead, but also less fidelity.

- **Pending:** when the RFC is submitted as a PR.
- **Active:** when an RFC PR is merged and undergoing implementation.
- **Landed:** when an RFC's proposed changes are shipped in an actual release.
- **Rejected:** when an RFC PR is closed without being merged.

### TC39

TC39 is an interdisciplinary group that is responsible for determining the direction of JavaScript. Staged proposals are greatly inspired by their process and the success. The shorthand provided by stage names helps bring clarity in communication.

 [Their process](https://tc39.es/process-document/) is divided into five numbered stages:

0. Strawperson

1. Proposal
2. Draft
3. Candidate
4. Finished

This format is not exactly suited to Ember because stages 0-3 are what we already do. What we need to offer is more detail for stages 3-4. However, thanks to TC39, we can see how useful it would be to have clarity and a shared language around the status of a feature.

### Rust

The [Rust RFC lifecycle](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#the-rfc-life-cycle) is very similar to Ember's, because ours was inspired by it. Following an FCP (Final Comment Period), an RFC is either merged, closed, or postponed. Merged RFCs are considered to be "active."

The concept of postponed RFCs is relevant to Ember's development, and possibly a good lesson to take:

- Some RFC pull requests are tagged with the "postponed" label when they are
closed (as part of the rejection process). An RFC closed with "postponed" is
marked as such because we want neither to think about evaluating the proposal
nor about implementing the described feature until some time in the future, and
we believe that we can afford to wait until then to do so. Historically,
"postponed" was used to postpone features until after 1.0. Postponed pull
requests may be re-opened when the time is right. We don't have any formal
process for that, you should ask members of the relevant sub-team.
- Usually an RFC pull request marked as "postponed" has already passed an
informal first round of evaluation, namely the round of "do we think we would
ever possibly consider making this change, as outlined in the RFC pull request,
or some semi-obvious variation of it." (When the answer to the latter question
is "no", then the appropriate response is to close the RFC, not postpone it.)

 As of the writing of this RFC, there are over [70 open pull requests](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pulls) for Ember's RFCs. Having so many open PRs is confusing for everyone, yet simply closing many of these PRs would not reflect the reality of the wish to bring these good ideas into Ember.

Another aspect of Rust's process that is relevant is the idea of modification, which is already part of Ember's process, but not widely used:

- Modifications to "active" RFCs can be done in follow-up pull requests. We strive to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of the feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next major release.

Many of Ember's merged RFCs are not implemented exactly as written. Once implementation is underway, new knowledge gained influences design. In other cases, implementation takes so long that some aspects of an RFC no longer apply. These decisions should be captured in writing as part of the process.

### Yarn and React

Both Yarn and React have adopted an RFC process similar to Ember and Rust.

You can see an example of updating a merged RFC in this [React RFC Pull Request](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/52/files).

### Make no changes to existing process

Following RFC 300, the [RFC tracking issue repository](https://github.com/emberjs/rfc-tracking/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) was created. This repository contained checklists that were meant to show the general, high-level requirements to ship an RFC in a stable release. Although the issues were helpful to learning resource writers, including the Learning Team, the Ember Times, and contributors, the tracking system did not provide much utility for our broader user community. Tracking issues were rarely updated.

Although it is still helpful to have a detailed view into the work being done, our community's greatest need is to show the overall status of an RFC's implementation in a consistent, reliable way. For this reason, it is necessary that we adopt RFC stages, and not stop at our current process.

## Unresolved questions

There are some ambiguities because RFCs take many forms. Our process cannot cover 100% of scenarios, but we should strive to find answers that cover the vast majority of RFCs.

- If we imagine that we did this process during Octane, how would it have helped, or not?
- For RFCs that have to do with technical features, should the release version indicate when it is in Ember's blueprint, or the name and version of the package itself?
- How do we resolve disagreements over stage names? Other stage examples include: "Ready to implement," "Active," "Rejected," "Obsolete"
- Should "Under consideration" be a stage, or a GitHub label on the Pull Request? What are the pros and cons?
- Should this RFC describe the process for gathering consensus to move to Release?
- Should this RFC mention the champion at all? Should they be responsible for moving it through stages? Or was their job over when it was merged?
- Would a "postponed" stage be accurate for many of our open, stale RFCs? Should there be a postponed stage?
